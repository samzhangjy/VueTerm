Search engine is a very powerful tool. However, if other tools could implant the most features of the search engine, then it will be even more powerful. But, I have not found any web spider to extract the search results accurately. So, with that goal in mind, I developed this project to crawl Baidu: BaiduSpider.

<br />

Hereâ€™s why:

- Makes things easier for data extraction, which speeds up the development of projects like deep-learning.
- Extract data accurately, without Ads.
- Provides in-detailed search results, supports multiple search types and typing annotation.
